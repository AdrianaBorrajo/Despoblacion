## **THE CHALLENGE OF DEPOPULATION THROUGH DATA SCIENCE**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103734869/217628993-b965d382-0ba1-4abd-9742-d4abe864eda7.png)

Work done by Adriana Borrajo Vali√±a for the online Master in Data Science taught by Kschool.  

The aim of the project is to conduct a 10-year diagnosis in order to predict the depopulation of a municipality in that period, and to try to find the most significant features.  
To do this, we use different supervised classification models to analyse and interpret territorial, demographic, economic and social features to anticipate the future needs of each municipality and prevent possible negative effects linked to depopulation. 

The steps followed in the project are as follows: 

**1. Introduction** contextualization of the problem and objectives set.  
**2. Data:** Compilation of the information for the conduction of the study.  
**3. Density_Map:** Choropoetic maps of the entire national territory with which a first diagnosis is made on how population density is distributed in the municipalities of Spain between 2011 and 2021.   
**4. Union_Depuracion_Data:** Integration of all the information previously collected in section 2 and subsequent data cleaning.  
**5. Preliminary_Variable_Analysis:** Preliminary exploration of the data and its corresponding descriptive analysis.  
**6. ML:** Training of 5 classification models, evaluation of the results and optimization of the model with hyper-parameter fitting.  
**7. Tableau:** Visualization of the data used in the project:
